# CTBot
___
### Introduction
CTBot is a simple Arduino class to manage Telegram Bot on ESP8266 platform.
It relies on [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) library so, in order to use a CTBot object, you need to install the ArduinoJson library first (you can use library manager).
You also need to install the [ESP8266 Arduino Core and Library](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino).
Don't you know Telegram bots and how to setup one? Check [this](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

+ **_Please pay attention to the installed version of ArduinoJson library: it MUST be 5.13.5 or lesser._**

### News
+ Added support for the 2.5.0 ESP8266 toolchain/library

### Feature
+ Manage WiFi connection (methods for connecting to an access point, set a static IP)
+ Send and receive messages
+ Inline keyboards
+ Receive localization messages (NEW)

### Supported boards
The library works with the ESP8266 chipset: all the ESP8266 boards are supported.

### Simple usage
See the EchoBot example provided in the [examples folder](https://github.com/shurillu/CTBot/tree/master/examples).
