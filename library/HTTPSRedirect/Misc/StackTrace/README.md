# ESP8266 Stack Trace Gedit Highlighing

This tool is a *gedit* language file for custom syntax highlighting. It is to be used with
the meaningful stack trace generated by the tool: [EspExceptionDecoder] (https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder).

## Usage:
Copy the file into the directory: 
```
/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
```

note: The exact path may vary based on the *gtksourceview* version and Linux distribution.

Save the output from EspExceptionDecoder into a file called **stack.trace**.
Launch gedit:
```
gedit stack.trace
```

The syntax highlighting will automatically be applied due to the extension (.trace). If it doesn't, you can apply it
manually from the menu item "View > Highlight Mode...". Select "ESP8266 Stack Trace" from the list of items.
